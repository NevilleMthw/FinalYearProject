# FinalYearProject
This project is for my final year individual project based on a data analytics report.

The project consists the use of Tableau for data visualizations and basic machine learning using linear regression. The project is based on flight analysis during COVID-19 with flight delay prediction before COVID-19 for the month of January.

The programming language used for machine learning is Python with a few libraries.
